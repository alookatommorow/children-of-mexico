<h3>The Children of Mexico International Story</h3>
<p>On one of her many trips to Guadalajara,Mexico, California native and seasoned speech pathologist Margarita Fajardo, had a life-altering experience when she visited an orphanage and met a young girl named Conchita. Conchita, born with cerebral palsy, was abandoned at the city dump.</p>
<p>Fortunately a garbage collector found her and she was then given a home along with 19 other disabled children and young adults at a home called, “ Bienaventurados de Jesus.” The following year Margarita returned bringing with her more therapists and equipment to help improve the lives of all the children there by enhancing their communication skills and thus, Children of Mexico International was created.</p>
